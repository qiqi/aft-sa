## Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol

This repository uses a multi-agent coordination system. **All agents (AI and human) must follow these rules.**

### Rule 1: Read Before Writing
Before generating or modifying any code:
1. Read `/AGENTS.md`
2. Check the "Active Agents" table for conflicts

### Rule 2: Respect Locks
If a file or folder is listed in the "Active Agents" table by another agent:
- **STOP** - Do not modify that file
- **WARN** the user: "⚠️ File `{path}` is currently locked by {agent_name} for: {task}"
- **SUGGEST** alternatives or ask user how to proceed

### Rule 3: Register Your Work
If the path is clear and you're about to make changes:
1. Add an entry to the "Active Agents" table in `/AGENTS.md`:
   ```
   | Your Role | target/path | Brief description | Current timestamp |
   ```
2. Then proceed with your work

### Rule 4: Clean Up When Done (must do before finish or when stopping to ask the user)
When your task is complete:
1. Remove your entry from the "Active Agents" table
2. If the file needs review, add it to "Ready for Cleanup" section
3. Optionally add a summary to "Recently Completed"

### Rule 5: Communicate
Use the "Communication Log" section in `/AGENTS.md` to leave notes for other agents if needed.

## Code Style

- Follow PEP8 with 100-character line limit
- Use NumPy-style docstrings
- Type hints encouraged but not required
- Prefer explicit imports over `from module import *`
